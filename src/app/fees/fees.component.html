      <h2 class="display-3" i18n>Reward Distribution</h2>
      <div class="col-md-12 text-left" i18n>
        We use PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares) to distribute rewards.<br />
        When a block is won, we look at the valid partials (shares) submitted by all users in the pool since last payout
        and distribute the reward value based on your share among all farmers in the pool.<br />
        In our case Last N Shares refers to partials since last payout. We believe this system is far more fair for less
        frequent rewards (when Last N Shares means only last few hours), since people contributing for more time will
        get more rewards.<br />
        Once our estimated time to win gets below 48 hours we plan on changing the Last N Shares to 48 hours of valid
        partials.

      <h2 class="display-3" i18n="@@Payouts">Payouts</h2>
      <div class="col-md-12 text-left" i18n>
        Payouts will happen within 5 minutes of the farmed block.<br />
