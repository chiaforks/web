        <h2 class="display-3" i18n>Fees</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
          Fees are structured this way:
          <ul>
            <li>Until 1st September 2021 (2021/09/01): <strong>0%</strong></li>
            <li>After 1st September 2021 (2021/09/01): <strong>1%</strong></li>
          </ul>
          Examples:
          <ul>
            <li><i>Before 1st September:</i>A reward of 1.75 XCH will be distributed to pool farmers, 0 XCH (nothing) is kept to the pool.</li>
            <li><i>After 1st September:</i>If a reward of 1.75 XCH is found, only 1% of that, 0.0175 will be kept to the pool as a fee. The remaining 1.625 XCH will be distributed to pool farmers.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="display-3" i18n>Reward Distribution</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
          We use PPS (Pay Per Shares) to distribute rewards. <br />
          When a block is won, we look at the valid partials (shares) submitted by all users in the pool since last reward and distribute the reward value based on your share among all farmers in the pool.<br />
          Unlike PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares), we believe this system is far more fair for less frequent rewards, since people contributing for more time will get more rewards. PPS and PPLNS are very similar when payouts happen at most once a day.
        </div>
        <h2 class="display-3" i18n>Payouts</h2>
        <div class="col-md-12 text-left">
          Payouts will happen within 5 minutes of the farmed block, while your estimated time to win is above 1 day.<br />
          Payouts will happen once a day when your estimated time to win is below 1 day.<br /><br /><br />
          <p>
          These terms are subjected to change and will be communicated 1 week prior to the change in this website and on Discord channel.
